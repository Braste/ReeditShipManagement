 REEDIT SHIP MANAGEMENT - V 1.1.2 (25/06/23)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Reedit Ship Management (RSM) is a broad, ship automation script tailor made for the Draconis Expanse server.

 • Provide a range quality-of-life functionality to make ships on DX easier to use and better.
 • Output a high-density, customisable LCD display (with hudlcd support)
 • Prevent configuration errors that can lead to combat failure or other mistakes.
 • Simplify ship control via fully-configurable 'stances'
 • Automate monotonous tasks like block naming so you can get a new ship up and running fast.

Draconis Expanse is a PvP environment, and scripts have been used as weapons before. I have and will do that on other scripts, 
but WE DON'T DO THAT HERE. As long as it's me (christophuck) handling the development of the script, it won't be used as a weapon, 
and I guarantee malicious code won't be added. If you experience such a thing, it's a mistake, please report it! The full, unobfuscated 
script is posted on github for all to review.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
This script is safe (all of my ships run it) but it is complex, and using it improperly can lead to damage or destruction of your ship.
Read the guide, ask questions, and practice.

DON'T FIGHT THE SCRIPT!
What? My PDCs keep turning back on when I switch them off! lol, RSM is doing that, and for good reason.
There's probably a stance or other option to achieve what you want with one command to RSM.
If it's freaking you out, just turn off the RSM PB!
